# Stationnary-Recognition-System-with-Machine-Learning
It is a stationary recognition system built with Python, applied machine learning models like CNN and SVM.

1. Classify the stationary in testing images.
2. Accuracy: 83% (CNN, with regularization and early stopping).
3. Training set: 6000 stationary images taken from popular.
